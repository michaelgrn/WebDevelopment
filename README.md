# Web Development

Contained in this repository are examples of web sites that I have worked on.

***LITERATE*** contains code for a research driven web app designed to retrieve materials suitable to children based on readability and word count. I was primarily responsible for developing a methodology that logs user interactions with the Search Engine, storing those details in a PostGres database. However, my duties also included adding and formatting pages to this project as well as debugging previously implemented features. Further details for of this project can be found in the folder.

The following links are websites that I have developed on my own:
